# Neural Networks and NLP (natural language processing)

It is a self education project, following a Udemy course, learning how to build and train a 

deep-learning machine for Natural Language Processing from Neural Network.

The technologies employed in this practice are Keras, nltk, spacy, numpy, pandas, etc.

The final objective of this project is to build and train a Neural Network as a QA (Question Answer) 

ChatBot. The architecture of this neural network is best describled in the attached article 

(End-To-End-Memory-Networks.pdf) by Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Arthur Szlam, Jason Weston, and Rob Fergus.

The training data is a set of story (statement), question and answer.
